# Social Media Engagement Analytics on Instagram

This project explores engagement metrics (likes and comments) from Instagram to uncover actionable insights for social media influencers. Using advanced data analytics, the project identifies strategies to maximize user engagement and provides data-driven recommendations tailored for micro and macro influencers.

## Project Overview

Social media platforms like Instagram play a significant role in online marketing and audience engagement. This project focuses on analyzing a real-world Instagram dataset to address key questions related to post timing, content type, audience size, and engagement strategies.

### Goals
1. Identify the best times and days to post for maximum engagement.
2. Evaluate the impact of post characteristics like hashtags, sentiment, and text complexity on likes and comments.
3. Compare engagement strategies for micro-influencers (<50k followers) and macro-influencers (>=50k followers).
4. Provide actionable recommendations for influencers based on data insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Log-transformed skewed variables (`LOG_LIKES`, `LOG_COMMENTS`) for better interpretability.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized trends and relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots.
   - Calculated descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created innovative variables such as:
     - **Engagement Ratio**: Followers-to-following ratio.
     - **Sentiment Score**: Analyzed positive/negative sentiment of post captions.
     - **Text Complexity**: Measured using Flesch-Kincaid readability scores.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Built regression models to predict `LOG_LIKES` and `LOG_COMMENTS`.
   - Compared model performance across questions using metrics like Adjusted RÂ², MSE, and F-statistics.

5. **Key Insights**:
   - Tailored strategies for micro and macro influencers based on data findings.

## Key Findings

1. **Best Time to Post**:
   - Posts in the evening (micro-influencers) and afternoon (macro-influencers) see higher engagement.

2. **Optimal Day to Post**:
   - Weekend posts outperform weekday posts, particularly for comments.

3. **Post Type**:
   - Photos generate more engagement compared to videos.

4. **Engagement Ratio**:
   - A higher followers-to-following ratio predicts increased likes and comments.

5. **Caption Analysis**:
   - Simpler text correlates with higher engagement (comments), while positive sentiment boosts likes.
